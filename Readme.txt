Language Used : Java 
Concept Used : Swing
IDE Used : Net Beans
Database Used : MySQL (Wamp Server)

To connect NetBeans to Wamp Server using libraries and add one library, its name is "MySQL JDBC Driver"

First of all, start NetBean and and add all files and 2 folder of my project.
Then, start Wamp Server, my Database name is "project2" so write "use project2".
In the folder db.sql file is there and in this file I have created all Tables just copy and paste.

Thats it, Now Project is in Working mode.
Thank you,
Have a great day....
